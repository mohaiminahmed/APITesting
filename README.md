- **Streamlit Web Interface**: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit for interacting with the API.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling for API requests and responses.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language used for API interaction.
- **Requests**: A Python library used for sending HTTP requests.
- **Streamlit**: A web-based Python framework used for creating the user interface.
- **Swagger API**: The project interacts with the Swagger Petstore API for demonstrating API testing.
